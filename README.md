# hello-world
using github for the first time.

Hi humans:

i am allan and i am so fascinated to start building in github.
i am a python junior programer in backend development, and i am extending my knowledge to data analysis, and maching learning.
i also want to let you know that everythings that i have learned i learned by myself, and i'll continue doing it.
